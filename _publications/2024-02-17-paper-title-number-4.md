Since urban development began, Beijing courtyard homes have struggled with issues like population growth, renewal and renovation, and a lack of available housing. While the population is growing, the size of the original house remains intact for the occupants. In light of this incremental growth, the primary methods of remodeling the main house involve advancing the exterior wall, making use of the front porch to expand the living space, and adding a loft at height of approximately 6 to 7 meters on the hard roof of the room, with stairs or climbing ladders connecting the upper and lower levels. However, despite the fact that ventilation is crucial to the home's indoor environmental condition, the designers did not give it enough consideration before the restoration. The goal of this essay is to investigate the effects—both good and bad—of two variations on the quadrangle's front porch and loft designs on the patterns of indoor ventilation. The comparative analysis approach is employed as the primary method in the study, with the front porch and loft serving as two variables to examine the internal ventilation of four distinct building models using CFD(Computational Fluid Dynamics) techniques. The sectional airflow study and the 1.5m height cloud in plane results show that the loft isolates the indoor airflow organization to some extent and makes the high interior windows less effective. Although the effect of occupying the front porch on ventilation is not significant, other effects on aspects other than ventilation need further study.
