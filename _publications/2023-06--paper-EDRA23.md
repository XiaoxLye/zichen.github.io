The primary room is the room where the head of family lives, and most important room in the courtyard, it's natural ventilation features are worth investigating, but there is a controversy when it is analyzed by CFD(computational fluid dynamics). This is largely because it is difficult to assess how the primary room is impacted by the nearby buildings, a problem that can be resolved in the field of CFD research of buildings by comparing isolated and non-isolated buildings. The purpose of this study is to analyze the natural ventilation characteristics and the positive or negative effects of its surrounding buildings on the ventilation performance of the primary room. The isolated primary room model and the conventional courtyard model are constructed separately in this research based on the typical architectural layout of a Qing dynasty Beijing Courtyard. Following discussion and review, major findings are established by comparing the simulation results of the two models: (1) The primary room and wing r on both sides must be included in the isolated model. (2) The surrounding buildings reduce the average wind speed within the primary room by around 50%, lowering the wind pressure on the building's surface. (3) The isolated building model is used to study the building's indoor ventilation characteristics.(4) The primary room has adequate natural ventilation. This study can generate fresh research ideas for the study of natural ventilation in traditional residential buildings, with the hope that the methodology of this study will be broadly applicable to courtyard-style buildings.
